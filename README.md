# Analysis

Welcome to this repository of Jupyter Notebooks for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**! ðŸŽ‰

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks where various datasets are explored using EDA techniques. The goal of these notebooks is to showcase the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. The main objectives of EDA are:
- **Understanding data distribution**
- **Identifying patterns and relationships**
- **Detecting anomalies or outliers**
- **Testing assumptions and hypotheses**

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Core programming language used for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ Interactive environment for creating and sharing documents that contain code, visualizations, and text.
- **Pandas** â€“ For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** â€“ For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib** â€“ For static data visualization.
- **Seaborn** â€“ For statistical data visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure of the Repository

- **data** â€“ Folder for storing datasets used in the notebooks (if applicable).
